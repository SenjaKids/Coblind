# Coblind (WWDC 2023 Swift Student Challenge Submission) [SELECTED]

Coblind is a color blindness simulator application that created with the aim of educating people about color blindness. There are an estimated 300 million people in the world with color vision deficiency. 1 in 12 men are color blind (8%) and 1 in 200 women are color blind (0.5%). I think that's quite a large amount. I myself also born with partial color blindness. In my life, whenever people find out that I have color blindness, most of them will immediately ask the color of the things around us. Actually it was quite disturbing to me because they immediately thought that I couldn't see any color at all even though I only suffer from partial color blindness where I only have difficulty distinguishing a few colors. I also hear stories from my friends and family who also suffer from partial color blindness that they also experience the same thing. 

These problem motivated me to use this topic to join the WWDC Student Swift Challenge and i create a solution to create an app that let user understand that colorblind people still can see color but see it differently. In this app user can learn about color blindness and simulate each type of colorblindness. In the simulation page there are rectangles that let user see what the color normal person and the colorblind person see. User can change the color by sliding the Red, Green, and Blue value slider. In the end of this app, user also can see randomly generated fun fact about color blindness. When developing this app there are many things that i must learn, especially regarding how to calculate the vision of people with color blindness. To calculate it i need to remember again my high-school mathematic topic (Matrix) which i donâ€™t remember at all. I also need to search research about color blind calculation which was hard to find in the internet. In create this app using SwiftUI and i create my own function inside the project to calculate each color blind type RGB.
